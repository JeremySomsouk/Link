I used [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to start my project.

To run the application, execute:
> mvn package
> java -jar target/link-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Then have fun :
> curl "http://localhost:8080/poi?lon=-7&lat=6.5"
> curl "http://localhost:8080/poi/densest/2"

What did I do ?
1. Parse the CSV File and simplify the numbers to their inferior bound (minus 0.4 maximum)
2. Get a list of positions
3. For each position : insert the position to a map with the key being "lon|lat", and the value is a counter
   -> if the key does not exists, we insert a new entry to the map with a counter set to 1
   -> if the key does exists, we increment the map's entry value

n.b. The big file is parsed but unused. Feel free to change the POIService to try that : tinyFilePositions -> bigFilePositions.
